Pete8051: This is nicely organized code, I like the seperation of pages using comments and keeping your variables first followed by your methods. When I ran the code I saw an error come up regarding the Facebook features that you added to it. I'm not sure if this error is just with me or if you are having trouble with it too. I haven't done that part with my app, so all I could do was compare the code to the book's, which appears to be accurate.
One thing I do suggest you change is the view on the second page that you put your main paragraph about yourself. The edges get cut off of near the left and right of the paragraph (on my device) and that can be fixed by reducing the size of your view's border. It's overlapping the words of your text, hence why they appear to be cut off. Other than that this program looks great.
